# Audio-Transcript-Translation-with-Whishper

The "Audio Transcript Translation with Whisper" project aims to build a system that can transcribe and translate audio files into different languages using OpenAI’s Whisper model. The project involves setting up Whisper for automatic speech recognition (ASR), converting spoken language into text, and translating the transcriptions into the target language. Key components include data preprocessing, configuring language models, and handling multi-language support. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in multilingual speech processing and is ideal for creating transcription tools, real-time translation services, or enhancing accessibility for diverse language speakers in media content.

Project Overview:

I have developed a project that leverages the Whisper model to perform both audio transcription and translation. The project showcases the power of Whisper, particularly its capability to automatically recognize speech in multiple languages, transcribe audio into text, and translate that text into the desired language. This application demonstrates how Whisper can seamlessly handle diverse audio processing tasks, making it ideal for building a multi-language translation service.

Setting Up the Project:

To begin the project, I set up the development environment in Visual Studio Code. This involved creating a requirements.txt file and installing the necessary dependencies, including OpenAI's API and Flask. Flask is used to develop the web application that powers the audio translation service, allowing users to interact with the system via a simple web interface.

Using the Whisper Model:

In this phase of the project, I used the Whisper model to transcribe audio. I demonstrated how to load an audio file and process it through Whisper to generate an accurate text transcript. The transcription process highlighted the model's ability to convert spoken words into text, even in noisy or diverse audio environments.

Creating the User Interface:

For the web interface, I designed a simple yet effective user interface using HTML and CSS. This interface allows users to upload audio files and select a target language for translation. The UI was built to be intuitive, ensuring that users can easily navigate the application and upload their files without hassle.

HTML and CSS for Web App Design:

I focused on creating a clean and functional design for the web application using HTML and CSS. The frontend includes an input form where users can upload their audio files and select the desired translation language. I prioritized a minimalist and user-friendly layout, ensuring that the design is responsive and accessible across different devices.

Audio File Translation Process:

Once the audio is transcribed into text using Whisper, the next step involves translating the transcript into the user’s specified language. I used GPT-3 or GPT-4 models to process the text and generate the translation. This step highlights the integration of Whisper with GPT models to provide a seamless translation experience for users.

Running the Web Application:

After completing the setup, I demonstrated how to run the Flask web application locally. Viewers were able to see how the web app functions, allowing them to upload audio files for transcription and translation. The application performs these tasks in real-time, showcasing its efficiency and functionality.

Final Output and Review:

The project concluded with a demonstration of the final output: uploading an audio file and receiving the translated text in the selected language. This process emphasized the smooth user experience and the effectiveness of combining Whisper for transcription and GPT models for translation. I also discussed potential enhancements and encouraged viewers to continue exploring and building upon this application.
